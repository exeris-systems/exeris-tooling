# Exeris Tooling — Roadmap to 1.0.0 GA

The tooling layer is the **build-time pipeline**: annotation processor reads
`@ExerisDomain` user code → emits `DomainMetadata` JSON → kernel-target Java
generators consume it → emit handlers, services, repositories, OpenAPI specs,
sagas. 1.0.0 GA means: **the codegen output is stable**, the Maven plugin API
is stable, and downstream user apps can pin to it with semver guarantees.

This file tracks scope per milestone. Items marked `[ ]` are open; `[x]` shipped.

---

## 0.1.0 — scaffold (shipped)

- [x] Maven multi-module reactor (`bom`, `parent`, `processor`, `codegen-core`, `codegen-java`, `e2e-tests`)
- [x] `@AutoService`-registered `ExerisDomainProcessor` reading `javax.lang.model`
- [x] `KernelArtifactGenerator` interface + 12 kernel generators (Handler, Service, Repository, Saga, Events, EventHandler, GraphSync, OpenAPI, Flyway, Application, Client, …)
- [x] Single-target story (Spring/Quarkus/Micronaut/Vanilla generators removed; multi-backend abstraction deleted)
- [x] Round-1 + round-2 review fixes (sendError JSON escape, OutputWriter timestamp drop, dep cleanup, BackendGenerator rename, ArtifactType trim)
- [x] `exeris-codegen-ts` Angular generator (npm package, separate build)

## 0.2.0 — quality gates + processor hardening

> Goal: regressions caught by CI, generated code provably compiles, processor diagnostics usable in real builds.

- [ ] **CI** — `.github/workflows/build.yml` (clones + installs `exeris-sdk` first, then `mvn verify`)
- [ ] **Compile-test gate** — KernelCodegenE2ETest currently asserts substring presence. Add a stage that compiles generator output against the kernel SPI in CI. **Highest priority — only deferred item that materially affects shipped quality.**
- [ ] **Processor minors** (see [issue #2](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-tooling/issues/2)): `triggerToEventSuffix` exact match; `-Aexeris.verbose` flag for `note()`; `e.toString()` + stack in error diagnostics; typed `AnnotationMirror` helper; `// LIMITATION` comments on `extractPathId`/`extractTargetEntityFromType`; `MetadataLoader` unused import; `@ActionParam`/`@InternalApi` default-drift verification against SDK
- [ ] **Pre-publish POM metadata** — `<scm>`, `<url>`, `<developers>`, `<distributionManagement>`

## 0.3.0 — codegen Maven plugin

> Goal: `mvn exeris:generate` and `mvn exeris:detach` are first-class build steps in user apps.

- [ ] `exeris-codegen-maven-plugin` module
- [ ] `exeris:generate` — runs the codegen pipeline against current source set, writes to `src/main/generated/`
- [ ] `exeris:detach` — promotes generated code to `src/main/java/`, removes it from `.gitignore`, drops the codegen invocation (L2 detachment level)
- [ ] `exeris:reattach` — inverse; re-enables on-demand regen
- [ ] Plugin uses Jackson 3 from day 1 (no `compile-testing` blocker — see SDK roadmap)

## 0.4.0 — codegen quality refactor

> Goal: collapse the duplication Sonar flagged (3.8% on new code, KernelHandlerGenerator 59.8%, KernelClientGenerator 40.6%).

- [ ] **`StringBuilder.append(...)` → text blocks** for SQL/YAML emission paths
- [ ] **JavaPoet** for Java-emitting paths — type-safe, compile-checked
- [ ] Shared scaffold extraction (package decl + imports + Javadoc + class header are duplicated across all `Kernel*Generator`s)
- [ ] **slf4j in `CodegenMain`** — replace `System.out.println` + emoji + box-drawing with structured logging. Required for clean Maven plugin integration.

## 0.5.0 — `@Capability`-aware codegen

> Goal: capability annotations (from SDK 0.4.0) drive additional generation paths.

- [ ] `KernelCapabilityClientGenerator` — emits typed clients for capability ports
- [ ] `KernelCapabilityHandlerGenerator` — wires capability event handlers
- [ ] OpenAPI spec aggregation for capability-exposed APIs

## 0.6.0 — codegen-ts hardening

> Goal: TS/Angular generator is on equal footing with Java (currently treated as preview-grade).

- [ ] Add `exeris-codegen-ts` to a top-level orchestration target (Makefile or `frontend-maven-plugin`)
- [ ] CI: separate npm-build job
- [ ] Round-trip tests against generated Angular workspace (compiles + `ng build` green)

## 0.7.0–0.9.0 — feedback-driven cleanups

- [ ] Generator output adjustments based on real budgetHQ + IDP-cap consumer feedback
- [ ] Performance: large-corpus generation profiling + fixes
- [ ] Memory: stream metadata loading instead of slurping all `*.json` upfront

## 1.0.0 GA — stable codegen + plugin

> Goal: any 1.x release produces source-compatible output; user apps' generated code keeps compiling across 1.x bumps.

- [ ] Generated-code golden snapshot suite (per generator, per scenario)
- [ ] `exeris-codegen-maven-plugin` API frozen (mojo parameters, lifecycle phase semantics)
- [ ] `KernelArtifactGenerator` SPI frozen (third-party generators can plug in)
- [ ] `MIGRATION-0.x-to-1.0.md`
- [ ] Maven Central release (processor + codegen-core + codegen-java + plugin)
- [ ] npm registry release for `@exeris/codegen-ts`

## Versioning policy

- **0.x** — generated code shape may change in any release; consumers regenerate after every tooling bump
- **1.x** — generated code shape changes only via additive minors; deprecation cycle for breaking changes
- Output artifact compat is the headline contract — Maven plugin API is secondary

## Tracking

- Per-milestone follow-ups: see open issues with `milestone: 0.X.0` label
- Round-1/round-2 review deferrals: [issue #2](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-tooling/issues/2)
